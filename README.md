## About
Tiny script containing just one, static method that takes any element and wraps each inline character in a given tag, with an optional class. Very tiny (3KB minified).

Version 1 of this was very blunt in its approach, stripping out any nested tags entirely. This version is much more polite, and will do its best to preserve existing markup.

The syntax has also changed almost completely, but should now allow for more graceful changes in the future.

## Setup

### Vanilla

Download one of the JavaScript files from the `dist` folder, probably the minified one.
Import it into your HTML:

```HTML
<script src="WrapChars.min.js"></script>
```


Ensure the DOM has loaded completely before continuing.




## Use

```javascript
WrapChars.wrap(elementReference, [paramsObject]);
```

Say we have the following HTML:

```HTML
<blockquote cite="Lewis Carroll" id="poem">
    <span class="line">â€™Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</span><br>
    <span class="line">Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</span><br>
    <span class="line">All mimsy were the borogoves,</span><br>
    <span class="line">And the mome raths outgrabe.</span>
</blockquote>
```


Grab a reference to the element you want to affect:

```javascript
let domElement = document.getElementById ('poem');
```


To wrap the characters using the default settings, call the `WrapChars.wrap()` static method using the reference as the argument:

```javascript
WrapChars.wrap (domElement);
```


You could also iterate over a NodeList if you prefer:

```javascript
let lines = document.querySelectorAll ('*.lines');
lines.forEach (line => WrapChars.wrap (line));
```


Note that this is a destructive process. If you think you may want to revert to the original HTML structure at any point you will need to store a copy of the original markup before applying the method.

Any leading/trailing whitespace from each text node is removed. Text nodes containing only whitespace are ignored completely.


### Configuration

`WrapChars.wrap()` accepts two arguments:

- `element` - a reference to a DOM element, e.g. as obtained via `querySelector()` or `getElementById()`.
- `params` - (optional) an object containing key/value pairs to configure the method (see below).


#### `params` object

The `params` object can contain the following properties, all optional:

- `type` - Defines how text nodes will be subdivided for wrapping. Currently takes a value of `'letter'` or `'word'`. Default is `'letter'`.
- `tagName` - The type of element that will be wrapped around each character. Default is `'span'`.
- `className` - The class name that can be applied to each wrapped element. Default is *none*.
- `spaceChar` - The character to replace spaces with, if specified. This can be an HTML entity, such as `'&ensp;'`. Default is *none*.
- `deep` - Boolean value where, if true, will parse the entire DOM tree of the element. If false will only wrap inline text of the element itself. Default is `true`.
- `skipClass` - If specified, any element with a matching class name will be ignored.



##### Example:

```javascript
WrapChars.wrap(myElement, {
    type: "word",
    tagName: "div",
    className: "wrapped_content",
    spaceChar: "&nbsp;",
    skipClass: "skip_this",
    deep: false
});
```



## Known issues

- `word` type doesn't deal with punctuation
- interferes with browser's text wrapping behaviour
- no option to not wrap node's entire sub-tree



## Version history

- v2.1.0 - Added *deep* and *skipClass* properties, improved whitespace handling.
- v2.0.3 - Added remove leading/trailing whitespace
- v2.0.2 - Fixed splitting by word removes spaces
- v2.0.0 - Near complete rewrite to play nicer with other people's markup
- v1.0.x - Original version
